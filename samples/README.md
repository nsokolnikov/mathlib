# NeuralNetwork

Sample application of neural network that detects deviations from a normal activity. The network is trained on a simulated  input that imitates variable activity for different days of a week. The network recognizes and reports low, normal, or high activity for that day, assuming that 20% deviation from the ideal target is still a normal activity.
